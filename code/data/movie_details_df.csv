78,MovieDetails,"In the ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"", which is a canon-prequel series to the Indiana Jones movies; we see a flash-forward to an old Indy, living in the 90s (1993). This Indy has an eyepatch and cane, and is telling the stories of his youth.

[Old Indy](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/indianajones/images/9/9c/George_hall_indy.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100728012056)

This implies that Indy won't die in his movies, but will eventually lose an eye. It is likely that he will eventually be used an old legend who helps a new generation of Adventurers and Treasure Hunters, and guides them on the proper path.

The franchise will likely see a soft reboot with a title such as:

""The Legend of Indiana Jones"" 

-in which *he* finally ends up as one of the legends and ""myths"" that he once chased; and someone tracks him down to follow-up on something he was involved with (likely a call-back to something like The Ark of The Covenant, for massive fanfare). 

There are only *so* many paths forward with the franchise without resorting to a hard reboot (which I sincerely doubt they'll do). This appears to be roughly what we're gonna get.

**Nearly pure speculation:** We'll likely see a young competitive boy and girl duo of adventures; rather than a shift of focus to a specific new lead. With the ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Uncharted"" movie franchises existing; the Indiana Jones legacy material will likey split the focus between two main leads rather than risk seeming too similar to these other movies. This also broadens the marketability and appeal of the legacy material.

 My guess: At least one of the new leads will be related to Indy, but not necessarily his son or daughter, but we could easily see another one of Indy's children, as he likely has a few kids out there (in addition to Mutt). I don' think we'll see Mutt in the first movie in the new Indy era, but I wouldn't be surprised to see an older, recast, and slightly different Mutt in a future installment.

Exley answers “no” to each, and this question and answer session demonstrates to us that Smith is corrupt and Exley is not. 

The questions are:

1. Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?

2. Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?

3. Would you be willing to shoot a hardened criminal in the back to offset the chance that some lawyer — ?

As the movie plays out, we see Capt. Smith committing the first two himself. The first by ordering the planting of the shotguns on the “three negros” and the second with him overseeing their subsequent interrogation, as well as with his actions at the Victory Hotel. 

We see Exley commit the third at the very end of the movie when he shoots Capt. Smith himself in the back.",Captain Smith’s Questions in L.A. Confidential (1997)

*Processing gif tloehoe0dot61...*",Something I noticed in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015).
59,MovieDetails,"&amp;#x200B;

[Every single time I re-watch this film and see her, I get a bit on edge.](https://preview.redd.it/plaaixl23ot61.jpg?width=479&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a5ae266d5555ed82a444173404c15ca474b82b)

This bug-eyed zombie, a white brunette with unkempt hair and blood or dirt on her forehead (It's hard to tell from the scene's color filter) can be seen in a very brief blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot. She's captured running toward the camera for 1-2 seconds at most during the 3rd act, when the horde chases the survivors as they attempt to escape the infested city. That face has stayed with me for years, ever since I first saw the *Dawn of the Dead* remake when I was between 13-14 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's the wide eyes or that she looks almost normal compared to the other ghouls, but something about her expression unsettles me more than most of the other featured onscreen zombies. Often times, the most unnerving undead from my POV, be it in movies, TV, games or other media, are the *""fresh""* ones (i.e. the most human looking). Ex- Zombie Luis. It provokes this Uncanny Valley effect where I know this is a person but something feels off (The animalistic shrieking certainly adds to that). So, naturally, the closer it gets to the camera, the more uncomfortable I become.

&amp;#x200B;

It's definitely not my favorite zombie makeup of the film. That honor goes hands down to the [zombie with exposed skull](https://rottenink.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dawn-of-the-dead-2004-5.png), who Andre encounters shortly after the group first enters &amp; explores the mall (My second favorite is [zombie-](https://pm1.narvii.com/6851/419d82e258a944490fc8ec088b07d40b10c05601v2_hq.jpg)[Vivian](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAnhk6_XkAE5BKW.jpg)). I've tried to find casting info. in the past on who this was, but came up empty. There were A LOT of extras playing zombies in this movie, after all. If I had to guess, this was not one of the ""hero"" zombies (The ones with the most detailed makeups meant to be at the forefront in group shots). Rather, she was one of the background ghouls who just happened to be caught in the footage. In this instance though, I'd say that worked to the film's advantage.
