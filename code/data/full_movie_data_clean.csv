7,1,"This Movie is Out There... Somewhere?I watched this movie on Netflix between 2014-2017. It was a horror/thriller movie set in a facility (I can't remember if it was underground) but the plot is that there is an experiment being preformed on humans' need for either sunlight or sleep (I think I was sunlight as I remember there were specifically no windows in the facility). There are two main characters, a man and a woman, and they were mid 20-early 30s. The man and woman met before entering the experiment and talk during it, and there are other side characters but I don't think any of them played a big role. 

The main things that stick out in my memory of this movie are:
• they each have a tiny room with no windows to outside but I think there might be a window on the main male character's door
•a main space to eat together
•a long hallway with the LED lights
•and there is an intercom voice that is a big part of their experiment that wakes them up, tells them when to eat, etc.. 

Throughout the movie there are different colored lights (like the LED rainbow lights) and the climax of the movie has the lights flashing different colors while the intercom voice is going crazy.

11,1,"I want to find a weird movie that I remember.I watched this movie when I was 9-13 maybe. I can remember only few scenes , and..  they are weird .

I watched this movie in russian language , but I can say that this movie was from america by it's style

The story:
~10 year old Boy lives with his dad , a policeman.
The boy found a DVD disk (or something like this , idw). This was very interesting thing to the boy and he decided to see what is this dvd . He opened the DVD player and saw something , that he should not see (it's not the ""Call"" horror movie). He was scared and he switch off the dvd player 


*and then sooomething and something and something happen between this scenes*

The villains were (maybe) a terrorist group (related to that dvd??). I remember 2-3 men members , possible one women and one very old women , granny.

In the next scene the boy was inside the car or the bus , with that scary granny .
She speaks with the boy , boy talking with her and the granny starts to tell a story

(The dialogue could be different)
"" did you see this ? ""
* she shows the hand under the glove*
*she had only 3 fingers on the hand*  
""I lost two other fingers by tragic accident .  The fingers now are with my *friend?*  and if he would know that you are here , he will do something bad to you""

The boy was very scared  andhe opens the door of the car and runs away from that old granny . When he was running , he saw a man ,  maybe that friend that granny talked about . He showed these two lost fingers of that granny. The boy runs away.



AND THE LAST SCENES
Policeman dad found out , that the boy was lost and he should find the boy.

The boy was in airport , inside the empty airplane. He was the hostage of that terrorist group. The granny was there too.
The villains planned to blow up the airplane and kill the boy .
 
Somehow the daddy comes and start fight with tgat group . He liberated the boy and dad told him to run away .

The boy leaves the airplane , runs 50 meters and started to see , how the bomb detonated because of the timer and blow up the airplane .

The boy screams and cry , calling for dad ....



And then dad sonehow survives  and he was not blowed up . He comes from that fire and the boy hugged him .

The end.





I dont think that you guys can find  this movie because this is sooo weird movie , I watched it 6-7 years ago , so i could not remember something , but I say , that I tell that , what i saw .

Sorry for the bad english .",2478
12,1,"A Young Love movie I had never seen but now I must!I went to the bus stop today with my boyfriend to head home. We were just talking I was happy maybe being silly (setting) and an older lady (like 60s 70s 80s her granddaughter i believe is 30) smiled at me and said you two remind me of a movie. Of course this made me insanely happy and I told her about how excited I was to see it when we got home, before hopping on bus and totally forgetting the title when my bus pass didn't work lol. These are the things she said about the movie.
1. I believe she said it was famous although I'm not sure to what agree I dont think I had ever heard of it
2. She did say at one point ""I still today think it's a movie that all teenagers should see at some point in their life during high school
    2a. This would obviously lead me to believe it was a book with life lessons 
     2b. Her use of the word still leads me to believe it could be older, (90s, 80s, etc)
      2c. Could be a classic movie even although I dont think I had seen it when she told me
3. The movie is not based on a book I asked
4. She said it was about a young couple in love, that loved each other their whole lives (I think she said since they were little ??) 
5. She told me at least three times that there were a lot of really happy times and a lot of really sad times in the movie 
6. I believe the movie ends on a happy note she said it was good so it could be good and sad if she didnt understand that I meant happy when I asked if the ending was good but I think it ended good and happy.
7. This is a huge clue: I THINK it was one word (the title of the movie) ALMOST POSITIVE 
8. As stated before I never saw it before now
9. I'm in my mid twenties with blonde hair, and my boyfriend is in early 30's with scooby-doo-shaggy long hair

Possibly some sort of glass wall or containment unit is set up in the room. This is very early in the movie.

But it’s about a girl that has long black hair. She’s petite and pale skin. At the beginning of the movie there was an ultra sound of twin babies I believe and one of them dies I’m assuming. And the girl is a senior in high school. She’s antisocial and gets bullied by a group of boys. She doesn’t really have any friends But she hangs out with a blond girl at school. The blond girl is in a relationship with a hockey player and im assuming the blond girl is an ice skater from the outfit she wore while skating to her bf that was at hockey practice. Then a bit later in the move the girl finds a photo of an ultrasound at her vanity type mirror near her window that I’m assuming that was in the beginning of the movie. This is where I stopped the movie to go do something the other day. 

And I think the movie was made in 2018. But I’m not too sure",1046

Or maybe they're a married couple who have grown apart but find their way back together. The part I remember is at the end, the couple is slow-dancing in their apartment and we see them from outside the window and they're dancing to the song ""Shake Down the Stars"" by Frank Sinatra w/Tommy Dorsey.

First one is a famous porn actor showing a man how he can make himself hard and flaccid at will. He holds his robe open and I think says “up, down, up, down” while his dick is doing the same (you don’t see his dick so I’m assuming it’s not actual porn...). 

The other scene is the porn actor and a group of people helping the man from the first scene get hard for a scene where he has to step in I think. Everyone is in a circle and humming around this guy while the porn actor says something like “and now I will take his jewels into my mouth”. Then the girl the flaccid guy likes does it instead and the whole ceremony works.

I don't remember enough of the plot, as far as I recall, there was a kid and maybe a couple of thieves who stole a car without knowing there was a kid in it, this couple were also lovers I think, a man and a woman, they ended up being friends with the kid. They even got him a Playstation and there was a scene were the kid was playing a racing game with the man.

76,1,"Horror fans! Help me find this movie based on description of the trailerHorror/Demonic possession theme  


I saw this trailer around Nov. or Dec. of 2019. I thought the movie would be out by now, but I can't find it anywhere on the lists of horror movies that came out in 2019 or 2020. I've looked at upcoming movies and can't find it either.

What I remember is that a boy is being haunted by an entity. It is in a rural/suburban town. He's having hallucinations and it's all very generic. The main thing I specifically remember is that there's a part where someone is looking out the passenger side of a car and sees the demon on the side of the road. I believe there's a crime scene with a group of CSI's investigating, and they are unaware of the being. I can describe it as insectoid, having a horizontal abdomen with legs and a tail, but with a humanoid torso and head. Sort of like an insect centaur type thing.

I remember it had a very generic name, such as ""The Wretched"", ""Antlers"", ""Relic"", or ""Son"". I've looked at all those, and ""Son"" and ""The Wretched"" seemed the most like it, though the demon never appeared.

I remember the trailer triggered a sense of ""Finally some good lovecraftian themes to look forward to"". So I don't know exactly what made me think that, but it could be that the movie had something like a cult or ancient Gods causing people to slip into madness. At the same time, I feel like there wasn't a whole lot of themes at play other than demonic possession. It seemed generic but good.

It wasn't a low budget looking film by any means. There were no snapchat filters or bogus dialogue in the trailer. The acting seemed real, though I can't remember any big names in it, and I didn't recognize anyone from any other movies.

Again, I've looked through all the lists I can find of movies that have come out since 2019, and I can't find it. I've done about 3-4 hours of looking on multiple occasions. There's a chance that it hasn't come out, or that it got scrapped. The trailer would have been on YouTube, not television, so who knows. Any help is appreciated.

86,1,"Trying to remember name of Horror movie from the 79’s/80’s??Ok so I’ve posted this many places over the years with no luck.  I watched this when I was a kid, maybe 8-12 years old which would be mid to late 1980’s / early 1990’s.  I watched it on TV so it could have been from the 70’s or earlier. It was broadcast with the original The Haunting afterwards, which scared me as well but not as much as the first movie, apparently.  I think I was probably too young to be seeing either movie but I guess my mom didn’t mind!!

Here is what I remember (sorry, it is disjointed but I was young):  

1) there was a character named David who was a main character I think.  

2)There were people staying in an old mansion or hotel - I don’t think they knew each other before this but I don’t remember why they are there.  There is a host who sits at the head of a large table at meal time.  Each guest experiences a  fear during  the first night.  

2) One is in the shower and it turns scalding hot - she grabs a towel to dry off and  it is covered in blood.  

3). Another guest wakes up to the voice of her dead child - bloody child sized footprints lead her to another room with a coffin in it - the coffin opens and her dead child  sits up and looks at her and says “hi mommy” or something like that 

4) Another guest gets trapped in a prison cell that drops over his bed and he can’t escape.  

At some point all the guests join at the dining table yelling at the host that this place is crazy and they want to leave but he won’t let them.  

The next night (I think), one guest or staff member patrols the hallways with a flashlight and looks at a portrait painting on the wall  because it seems like the eyes are following him.  He decides that’s not the case and continues down the hallway.  We see a person/image protrude from the painting and start to follow him down the hallway. 

At some point a chandelier in the main Ballroom suddenly  falls and nearly kills someone.  I don’t remember much about this but it might have been David that was almost killed as I remember someone calling out that name.  

This is not The Haunting, or Haunting of Hill House - it might be a TV production or remake of one of these movies but I haven’t found anything to support that.  

This movie seriously freaked me out and still does - and probably got me into loving this genre.  I had nightmares for at least a week after watching it (but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s actually shit and not scary at all - I was young).

time- I think the movie is like 1930s it had the feel as no voice was in it every time someone talked it showed a text box afterword to show what they said it had some sfx but nothing crazy.

people- all the characters I can recall there was the kids one teen girl and some younger siblings idk how many i just knew they there was one other one maybe. 
another young girl who is obviously a girl but for some has tricked the other teen girl into thinking she is a dude named...chris maybe. she is wearing black and has a black toque/beanie. 
the scary fucking mother idk if she is just normal and it's lighting but her face creeped me out and she was a strict scary constant who would look over the island with a spotlight (I think a light house) and shout through a megaphone/speaker at her daughter to come home for the night.

Plot- As much as I recall it was basically the girl (chris?) shows up to this island/coastline for some reason (is mysterious) and is pretending to be a guy and starts a relationship or crushship with the other teen girl at one point the other girl shows her boobs/boob and chris is interested and touches it. the mother is a scary woman who has this giant light she uses to look around the island and speaker she talks through basically telling her kids to get home. she comes off as intimidating and scary and controlling

175,1,"Looking for a Christmas movie where a boy(the protagonist) becomes Santa’s elf after dyingThe premise is a bit fake but I remember it being a positive movie. The boy is a mailman as I recall and I think he gets lost in the woods during a blizzard and dies. Anyway when he passes away he becomes an elf and goes to help Santa plan Christmas along with other elves (who also died). He accepts his new life but at some point he recalls his old life and a girl he liked and wants to go back to her. Other characters in the movie that I recall was the elf that welcomes and helps the boy, who is African. Another elf was this middle aged woman who I suppose was the equivalent of mrs clause. The main conflict during the movie is that something bad happens and the elf’s souls are threatened, they start to fade idk. It all ends well and I think the boy is able to come back to life or something to be with the girl.",911

Pretty much starts with an ice cream truck with a woman inside, with cameras inside that watch certain places. this guy bikes to chase it, and when he holds on to the ice cream truck, he falls and loses his legs. a few others guys die bc of it. then idk the rest until i think the main character goes to a skatepark with people until they realized they were on sacred indigenous land, and skeletons or some shit started to attack them, a few died, a few lived. the main character finally caught up to the truck and saw the cameras, and i don’t remember the rest.

181,1,"Trying to find the name of this movie.I had watched this movie quite a long time ago(when I was a kid or teen) and only remember glimpses of it. I don't remember anything more than a few scenes. It is probably one of those raunchy Italian oldies.

Scene 1: A girl and two guys are just wandering around what appears to be a lonely road or a park. They see a couple on a bench kissing passionately, unaware of the three. So, this trio hide behind the bench and one of the guys gropes the woman's breasts. The woman doesn't suspect anything and continues to kiss her partner. Later the couple find out and the trio run away.

Scene 2: One of the guys and the girl from the trio are walking in a forest and reach a waterfall. The girl asks the guy to face the other side while she goes to have a bath under the waterfall. The guy isn't able to control his curiosity for long and decides to peek. The girl is shown bathing nude with her rear visible.

Scene 3: These two(the guy &amp; the girl) are at a countryside now. It starts raining and they look for shelter. They find an old, isolated house and run towards it. The guy tries to make a move to kiss her, but she runs away from the house. Later(still raining), she calls the guy towards her. She then removes the top of her dress, flashing her breasts, and they start kissing passionately.

This is all I can remember.

I recently watched this film, and I cannot for the life of me think what it was called.
I know it had Samuel L Jackson in it.
And I’m pretty sure it was set in Belmarsh Prison.

Here’s what I remember from the film; 
A man was arrested for killing his wife and her lover, so he did jail time, and a few years into it, he had made a few friends, Red being his closest (L.Jackson). 
One of the prisoners finished his time, but hated being out of prison, so he hung himself.
In his honour, the main character started to try and get a library in the prison, and named it after the dead guy.
It was eventually discovered that he was innocent and didn’t kill them, and someone else confessed, but the police didn’t what this news to get out, so they shot the messenger and kept the innocent guy in jail.
He later escaped by digging a hole in his cell wall (which he covered with a poster) and got out through the sewage system.
He was then allowed to be free as his innocence was proven.
Then Red (Jackson) was allowed out, and went to find his friend, via a note he left in a brick wall by a tree.

A middle aged lady is self conscious, and tells Teller not to ""tell tales"" about her to his sister or his friends. Teller carries a toy (I think a pogo stick but I'm not sure) to his mother, who says the self conscious woman talked her ear off, so she's tired and can't get the rest of the toys. So Teller goes and gets the other toys from around the corner of the building. Teller's mother waits for him by the door. 

I next have this distinct memory of Teller's parents realizing he's missing. His dad runs down the sidewalk yelling his name, and comes up to the old man. The man makes some kind of sly remark, and then they hear someone say, ""dad!"" Teller is running down the sidewalk and runs into his dad's waiting embrace. He hugs him like he's scared. 

That's all I remember. At this point, I'm worried that I may have made it up. Sometimes, movies I watched when I was young but haven't in a while come back in my dreams, and that's what happened with this one.

\- a family of three (mother boy girl) goes on road trip and along the way they stop at some caves. the two, brother and sister go into the caves. the mom flips out bc she cant find them and after a while of searching the both appear. that night they act strange at the hotel and at the end of the movie she tries to return to the cave but is replaced by an evil copy of herself (the same way her kids were replaced)...... thats all i remember.",488
238,1,"Old Horror MovieSo I saw a movie in roughly late 2008-early 2009 but am unsure what it's called and when it was actually released. 

In the movie, there was a group of young people who decided to stay at a haunted house (I dont remember why), some of the people walked into an empty room and the door to the room slammed shut and a female ghost chased the group into a closet. When they thought she left, a girl opened the closet door and the ghost now upside down on the ceiling drove an axe through her chest. Also I remember a kid I think but a male at least walking through the attic I think surrounded by wax figures and there was an entity in the room with him. I also remember a scene where this woman was asleep in bed with who she though was her boyfriend. Her boyfriends was actually was taking a shower and when he came back and turned the lights on she questioned who was next to her, looked and theres a skeleton who motioned them to shh and reached over to turn a lamp off. I believe the house started shrinking at the end of the movie and they had to bury a skull.

I hope this helps, I've been looking for years and havent had luck.",1148

251,1,Horror movie I can’t remember the name ofI remember buts and pieces of this horror movie I watched when I was younger but can’t find it anywhere. It was a group of people that all had similar nightmares as kids. When they get older they see them again. I remember a scene where one of the characters is in the bathroom and pulls out a big sliver from the back of his head and that was how the monsters tracked you. The monsters could only exist in complete darkness but they could drag you into their world if they got the chance. At the end of the movie the last surviving lady is in a mental hospital I think but goes to her closet and the monster gets her. The movie ends by a orderly coming in and looking in the closet to see the hangers moving and then it goes to the dark world where the lady is banging on the border between worlds trying to get his attention but can’t. When he closes the door it goes dark and you see the monster grab her and her screaming. I can’t find the name of the movie for the life of me.

254,1,"Please help me find this Movie (probably direct to TV) 3 kids made their way up a mountain to find a treasure &amp; a missing kid before one of the 3 kids moves out of town, they instead found the death body of the missing kid and a pin (IS NOT: “STAND BY ME”)Before I begging I apologies for any writing errors, English is not my native language

I also want to repeat that this movie is not “Stand by Me”, most likely is that is inspired by that movie/book, because is also a “coming of age film” with some heavy topics, the kinds almost die in more than one occasion and there’s also the death body of a kid close to the end, however I repeat IS NOT “Stand by me” (also, there is not “Gummo” a 2000’s movie that is quite disturbing, is not that one either)

Now, I saw this movie around 9 to 8 years ago, I’m 90% sure I saw it on one of HBO’s channels (probably HBO Movies) as I remember watching the animated movie: “Babar” just before watching this one in a Sunday during a TV marathon, however it might have been in another channel although that’s very unlikely

The movie stars with a pickup truck (it might red) arriving and parking in front of a church that has a cemetery next to it under heavy rain (with some light fog), before cutting to the inside of the truck, in the passenger seat there’s a white blond teenager girl (like 13 or 15) while on the driver seat is her father a white man in his late 30’s early 40’s

The dad (who I will be calling John to make this easier to follow, just keep in mind that’s not his name as I can’t remember it), says that they have arrived but that they well need to wait until the rain passes, the girl somewhat annoyed askes her dad why are they doing here, he tells her that they have come to see a “specially friend” to return something to him, the daughter them ask who this special friend is, John them put his had in his pocket and recovers a small circular pin (I think it was golden/Yellow) with a bird like creature draw on it, it might have being real or from fantasy, the girl takes the pin and examines it while the dad tells her that this will be a long story

After that the movie jumps back to what I can only assume are the 80’s (base in a old computer that appears in a scene of the movie), is here when we are introduce to the other 2 kids and John’s friends, who both are stereotypes, one is the “cool” kid that wears something black (I think it was a jacket) and can be kind of an asshole form time to time (I will call him Mike); the other one is a nerd, is the shorter of the 3 needs classes and has asthma that he hates (I will call him Scoot), Jhon is the more normal of the 3 and leader of the group, by the way the 3 are all white 

Now, for what I remember they are sneaking around the house of an old lady that according to school rumours is crazy or that she has force her son to stay inside the house like a prisoner, while sneaking is explain to the audience by dialog that the reason why they are basically braking-in someone’s property is because John is moving out of town in just 2 weeks as his dad got a new job in the city, and John wants to do a few things he always wanted to do but never dear to do so.

Anyway, after sneaking around the house going form window to window until they found the room of the kid and after looking inside it for a few seconds, the old lady sees them, now I can’t remember if they managed to scape but the next day John came back with the other 2 to apologies or if John confronted her or she managed to chat them but what ever it was John ends up in her house alone.

Now, the old lady is in her late 40’s early 50’s as her face is full of wrinkles and her eyes are sinking, however she also has a black hair with a few white hairs here and there; she begins to tell John about her son (who I will be calling Johnny) , who had being missing for around 10 years or more, explaining him that John and his friends remained her of her son and his own group friends (who were also 2), she them shows him Johnny’s room, that is basically the room of a kid form the 70’s (or at least it looked very 70-tish for me when I watched the movie)

The old lady them sits on her son’s bed and shows John a photo album his son had, the album is full of photos of Johnny and his friends as well as pictures of the old lady, all having this vintage 70’s look, with the weird quality and coloration, the pictures are basically a mirror of John and his friends, although none of them wear anything black or use glasses; while she looks at the album she explains that Johnnie’s father abandoned them after she told him she was pregnant, meaning that she took care of Johnny alone, she also tells him that Johnny was very shy and saw his friends as brothers, sadly their friendship will end when both move out of town, that got Johnny very depressed and shortly after he disappeared without leaving a trace

The old lady them stars crying while John tries to comfort her, after she calms down she points at some papers and a notebook on Johnnies desk, telling him that they might be a trace to find Johnny but she was never able to figure it out, but that maybe he and his friends will be able to do so, she tells him that they can keep what ever they find and that she only wants to know what happen to him, John takes the stuff and tells her that he will se what they can do before leaving her home to reunite with his friends, telling them what happened before asking Scoot if he could decipher the notebook and the papers.

The movie them cuts to the following day, Scoot is sitting in front of the old computer I mention before while John and Mike are next to him, Scoot explains to them that despite his best efforts he haven’t being able to decipher anything, with Mike saying something like: “I thought you say this thing could solve anything” while patting the computers monitor

Suddenly, while looking at the keyboard Scoot says something like: “how did I not see it before?” and stars tipping something in the computer slowly, he had desirer the message written in a piece of paper using a type-writer, the message was written using a method I have never hear of or seen anywhere else

You probably already know this but the way the different letters of the alphabet are organised in the keyboard is very specific and specially design for the English language, the top row (Q to P) contain the most use letter in the English language, the second row (from A to L) contain the letter with a medium use and the bottom row (z to m) contain the less used letters (this system of organisation has being in use from the last decades of the 1800’s to today); now the messages were encrypted/written using the key under the key for each letter of the word, basically meaning that:

A will be Z, B will be the space bar and so it will be C, D will be C, E will be D, F will be V, G = B, H = N, I = K, J = M and so on, to give you some examples; 

Hello will be something like: “nd..l” / Movie will be: “(space bar)l(space bar)kd” / Good bye will be: “bllc (space bar)hd” 

You probably get the point by now, also keep in mind that my keyboard is a little small so it might not all line the same way in your keyboard and mine

This is an important scene in the movie because here is discover that Johnny’s old group of friends had a name “The club of …” and I can’t remember what the last word was, but I’m pretty sure that it was name of the species of bird or mixological creature on the Pin I mention before and that appeared drawn in the notebooks and papers more than one time, as well as the mention of a treasure.

Now according to my sister who watched the movie with me,  the name of the movie was the name of the club (my memory says something similar, however I remember that the word treasure is also present in the tittle, something like: “In search of the club of the … lost treasure” or “The treasure of club …”), the problem is neither she or I can remember that word because it was a weird word, in fact I remember that and she and I have problems remembering the word 10 minutes after se finished watching the movie

IMPORTANT: I WATCH THIS MOVIE IN THE SPANISH, MEANING THAT THE TITTLE MIGHT HAVE BEING CHANGE DURING TRANSLATION, SO THE TITTLE OF THE MOVIE MIGHT BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

Anyway, so after Scoot decipher the papers, they discover that Johnny’s old group of friends had a “treasure” in their club house that is on top of a mountain that was right next to the town, so with that information they decided to go to it and make preparations

The following day the 3 reunite early in the morning, all three caring backpacks, and begging to discuss the route they have chosen to get to the top of a mountain, is here when Scott ask why they are walking all the way instead of taking the bus, to which Mike responds: “because that’s against the rules of treasure hunting”, something he will regret saying so soon as he finished saying it

You see, someone overhear him, a white blood girl (that by the way IS NOT PLAY by the same actress as the gird in the car) that is 1 year maybe 2 older that John or any of his friends, and is also the leader of a group with 3 integrands counting her (the other 2 being some boys) who are a bunch of bullies and like to cause problems around town (like break crystals with slingshots), also I think I remember that later in the movie the girl explains that her dad is an alcoholic and that he beats her and her mother but I’m not sure about that.

Anyway, the gird and her 2 followers star to chase John and his friends but they managed to lose them after leaving the town and entering the forest, the problem is now they can’t use the road, because the bullies are using it to at least get to the top of the mountain, so John and friends are force to move through the forest following an old dirt road that it use to be the running/marching course of an old military base (you know thus roads of rock and dirt that when across and around the perimeter of the base and when for miles/kilometres) that was build close to the top of the mountain in WW2 but was abandoned in the early 60’s meaning that now was just a line of dirt and rock in the ground with most of it already claimed by nature and was a hell to use   

This meant that soon it was afternoon and they have made no progress and because of the chase they were already running out of food and water, so they get close to the main rood as there’s a store next to it very close to the forest to get some stuff, the problems is that they didn’t bright much money (I think it was less than 5 dollars)

John suggest that they should buy something cheap and sheer it while following the main road while Mike says that they should try to steal something telling Scoot that he should be the one to go to the store and steal the stuff as he is the most innocent looking of the 3 (remember that I told you that Mike could be kind of an asshole form time to time? Well I was talking about this)

John says that is a stupid idea but aggress with Mike, but tells Scoot that he doesn’t need to do that, but Scoot insists that he will (I think he had an overprotective mother and he always was trying to prove that he was perfectly capable); so he goes to the store and puts some stuff in his pockets (chocolate and soda) before walking to the counter with a bar of chocolate, he pays for it normally while the store owner (who is at the counter and is an old somewhat overweight man) makes him some questions because it was very obvious for him that Scoot was doing something bad, and Scoot realises that he knows because soon he’s trying to hold back tears, the store owner moves to catch him but before he’s able to do so Scoot runs for the forest and despite his asthma he and the other 2 kids manage to out run the store owner

After they reast and eat they continue walking and soon they found other obstacle, remember the military base form WW2, well before it was abandon it was turn into a test field for explosives, the area was fence off with a 5 meter/16 foot tall chain-link fence, and that’s the obstacle I was talking about, now after reading a sign that basically explained that the entering the area was dangerous as there might be undetonated explosives that might go off any minute, the 3 decided that they prefer to go around it that just climb the fence and walk across the area, luckily they are close to one of the corners so they don’t need to walk that much however as soon as they star to wall around the fence Scoot stumbles and falls to the ground but with the help of the others help him to get back to his feet and the 3 star to walk (this is important, remember it)

Well after over 1 and a half hours, they managed to get around the fence and are back in the path, is already dawn and the 3 are discussing if they should star a fire and camp for the night when suddenly they are catch by the bullies, they try to run but this time Scoot has a has an asthma attack and they end up getting catch by the bullies who beath both Mike and John (just a little) who had stopped to help Scoot.

Now it turns out that Scoot lost his inhaler when he stumbled and felled right as they arrive to the military base, and after a little back and forward John and the girl decide to go back and get the inhaler while Mike and Scoot stayed there under the watch of the other 2 bullies

When they arrive to the military base, the girl tells John that they are not going to run around the base and that they should cross it, so she and Jhon climb the fence and run across the field, they made it safely to the other site and after checking John finds Scott’s inhaler, they them climb the fence and make their way back, however unlike the last time, this time they literally run into a problem.

While running John hears a weir metallic noise and asks the girl to stop, who says she’s standing on something, the John checks and indeed she is on top of something a grenade ( \[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Schema\_Grenade-en.svg/800px-Schema\_Grenade-en.svg.png\](here’s a link to the parts of a grenade so you know what I’m talking about), not only that but the metallic noise he hear was the safety pin and now the only thing preventing the grenade from exploding was the foot of the girl that was holding the lever in place and as John explains if she takes her foot off, they only have 10 to 15 seconds to run; however the girl says that it will not explode while John insist that it will in the end he convinces her to take her foot off while he kicks the grenade as far as her can, they do that and run before taking cover, after 30ish seconds the girl makes a sassy comment that she was right, only for the grenade to explode.

After that close to death experience, the girl and John return and give the inhaler to Scott, after that the 6 (John’s and his friends and the girl and the other 2 bullies) pass the night in the forest, I think is here where the girl tells John about her alcoholic dad, but I’m not sure about that.

Anyway, the next day the group arrive to the top of the mountain, now I remember that in top of the mountain was something a human construction, maybe the ruins of a mansion or fort of the colonial age I don’t remember what exactly it was but there was something there; now according to the message that talked about the treasure, now the group starts to search the thing on top of the mountain trying to find the club house of Jonny’s old group of friends

Now I don’t remember how exactly it happens but the group finds the club house, although they end up spitting, with John, Mike, Scoot and the girl ending in the club house while the 2 bullies have no idea where they went.

Now the old club house was a cave and if remember correctly, there was a way to enter it using a hole in the ground, but there was no way out, it used to, I think it was a lather that broke, but now they are trap in there, however while looking for a way out they find the “treasure” as well as Jonny

Just as they arrive they use a torch they have brought to illuminate the cave, they found a box full of now empty candy and other junk food wrappers, and in a rock next to it, there is Jonny death, lying down on his side resting in a fatal position and cover with a small blanket, her skin so pale its basically white, he had died there probably of hunger after he ended up trapped in his and his friends club house, and the movie is not afraid of showing the death body.

Now John notices something on front of Johnny’s body, the pin he later will show to his daughter in the car, and according to Johnny’s mother his most valuable position; he takes it and explains the other that he will give it back to Johnny’s mother

After that the 4 try to find a way out when Scoot notices something, in a part of the cave there’s a big drop, that is like 10 meters/32 feet and in that hole there’s water that is shining, in fact they notice the hole because the illuminates of the water is  enough to illuminate the ceiling of the cave that combine with the water made a weird shadow that make Mike thing it was a ghost

Anyway, with that information Scoot deduces that this body of water might leave them to an exit out of the cave as there’s a river close to the top of the mountain and is point of origin is a cascade that comes from a cave, and he believes they are in the point of origin of that cave and that they only need to jump and swim to the light to get out 

After some back and forward Mike is the first one to jump followed by Scott, John was about to jump when the girl asks him if they can jump together, they do so and soon the 4 swim to the light, they almost drown while doing so, but they made it out                           

The bullies came running after hearing the group talk and threatened the group to give them the “treasure” trying to fight the dad for the pin, but the girl told them to basically f\*\*\* off and that the only thing there was a death body making the bullies run like babies

The group return home (this time probably by buss), everyone got grounded, however John was able to go to the old lady house and explained everting that had happen giving her the pin he recovered, however she asked him to keep it

Finally, the day the John moved his two friends came to say goodbye (with the Mike joking that he will send Scoot to visit John by mail), the girl also show up and kiss the dad (is also implied that she later became his wife and is the mother of the girl in the car).

The movie ends with the girl (of the car) putting flowers in the tombstone of Johnny and his mother (who had recently died) and the father putting the insignia on top of Johnny’s grave stone, mentioning that it took years to recover the body but they managed to do it before the mother died with the girl mentioning that it would have being nice to meat both; the 2 them returned to the car with the girl asking if mom’s knows the story and the dad telling her that that’s how he meet her, the camara them pants to the tombstone and the pin before the credits star with the pin in the background

262,1,"Cannot find this movie for the life of mePlease help. I want to watch a movie that I watched YEARS ago and Google cannot help me. 

I can only remember the plot and no actors, or the name (obviously).

The plot (I may have added some pieces but
I’m going to try and be specific): 

Basically several people who have no idea who they are are trapped in some room or circle and forced to talk to each other and “figure something out”. After a certain amount of time someone gets killed seemingly at random (it’s not random). 
They eventually start to connect their lives after a couple people have been killed and realize they were all connected to some dude. 

What had happened was is one of the guys in the circle robbed a store and got away but this aforementioned dude was there and got blamed, charged, and sent to prison. In prison he gets raped and contracts hiv and dies. Since he wasn’t guilty the father is avenging his death. 

All of the people trapped in this room could have made one choice differently and his son wouldn’t have died because along the way people kept making choices like covering something up or not coming clean about the crime or actually raping him in prison, etc. 

At the end they all realize why they are there because the perfect sequence ended the dudes sons life. 
Somehow the lawyer law woman Kills the father and covers the whole thing up and that’s the end of whatever. 

Please help me remember what this movie is... or if I dreamt this. 

I also think that the killing when in some sorta clock theme rotation. 

Thank you I’m advance and if you don’t know the movie I hope you enjoyed reading (sorry for spoilers). 

If I posted this in the wrong place I am VERY sorry. This is my first post. :)",1739

318,1,"Figuring out a 'Sci-fi / Horror' movieHonestly since I've yet to find this movie (i've been lowkey looking for it for YEARS) I feel like it might've been a dream or a mix of different movies. Here is what I remember :  
\- Man tries to jump in front of train \[trying to kill him self\]

\- Everything goes white and he appears in a room with some big black object \[doesn't die?\]

\- After awhile the object 'opens' or does something and they get transported to different 'horror' scenarios. 

\- One scenario  I vividly remember was a statue (like statue of liberty size) came alive and they had to escape it. (it was like destroying buildings and stuff and they had to not die)

\- There was another scenario (super vague memories), I remember a garage door opening revealing like gas or something with like zombies coming out attacking people (most scenarios just had a few people in it, like everything was empty), I remember like their faces melting? idk super vague memory to me

\- The protagonists brother (dont know why he was there) apparently dies in that scenario and its revealed at the end of the movie that they need like 10,000 points or something (depends on how well they survived?) to bring all of those that died in the scenarios back to life.

  
**Extra things I remember:**  
\- I think the protagonist was Asian \[I could be really wrong lol\]

\- at some point in the movie he wakes up in his apartment and has a couple different powers like being able to jump high or something. Its a vague memory but i remember it didn't last long and he was back in the room with the black thing

Many of you may not be on the same tracks as me, but let's try and make some late analysis about this movie!

       About [Tarantino](https://www.monkeystream.net/star/quentin-tarantino):

There is no filmmaker whose personality is more apparent and present in both his writing style and directing other than [TARANTINO](https://www.monkeystream.net/star/quentin-tarantino)! he introduces us to his own view full of violence but at the same time provides us with many sentimental and elegant scenes , this is the mixture that makes this writer/director unique.

you'll know it's a Tarantino movie just by looking at some shooting angles in various scenes as you'll notice two specific angles :

extreme close-ups: Quentin is the master of close up shots! he knows how to perfectly utilize them.They are nerve wracking and exciting angles! through them ,he can picture a character's ferocity in his look as he can  reveal vulnerabilities exposing him.

Sometimes,these close-ups give more about the personnage than dialogues themselves.

the low angle shot:you won't like the idea of you being in a trunk, in fact you'll hate it! but Tarantino will make you love these shots! he himself loves to encrust his view inside a trunk. It is an effective way to allow the viewer to live the moment,the scene,in all its intensity! he even made a low angle shot in [""Django Unchained""](https://www.monkeystream.net/watch-django-unchained-2012-online-hd/) the[Western](https://www.monkeystream.net/star/quentin-tarantino)***/*** [Drama](https://www.monkeystream.net/genre/drama) Movie although there was no automobile trunks at the story's time, I myself loved that scene!

In this movie(more of a fairy tale), Tarantino went to the late 60's and early 70's where Hollywood is having a dramatic transition period,bringing in fresh blood,new actors and directors which means new styles, to picture for us a once successful actor and his double that are struggling to get a firm place in this whole new Hollywood, the movie also pictured the Manson family.

The movie didn't truly portray what life in Hollywood at this time would've been and presents us a dream: Tarantino's dream! but was this one compelling? and did it accomplish it's goals in Cinema? i will answer my own question at the end...

Rick Dalton is the main character,played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cliff Booth his stunt double performed by Brad Pitt. despite their many struggles, both of them live pretty blessed lives in a beautiful area populated by glamorous and rich.alongside the murders of the Manson family that occurred in august 69,representing the end of the innocence in Hollywood and the beginning of a more brutal and cynical one.

as in many of his previous movies, Tarantino put the second role character -Cliff Booth- more ahead,as the screen was mostly occupied by Brad Pitt, not by time in screen, but by the ferocity of the character and its invincibility, he seemed very powerful ,fearless, very loyal,strong and moderate at the same time. he really was a big part of the script as he encourages and supports the main character to move forward.

the movie also follows Sharon Tate played by Margot Robbie. she represents the new dream that everybody chases in Hollywood, in the opposite of Dalton who is trying to save his career from a dark end.

The character of Sharon Tate is just enjoying the new prospect of being a Hollywood shining star neighbouring the most famous people of the industry.

in my own view, Tarantino put too much focus on the time but not enough build on the characters, the conclusion of the movie is surely lots of fun, but it has nearly no meaning at all, as we watch those Manson family members get what they deserve at the end.

None of that reflects reality where Sharon Tate lost her life the night of 9th august 69.

the movie ending in Sharon Tate meeting Rick Dalton initiating a relationship where strong business collaborations could occur leading to fame golden gates for Rick Dalton.

MY THOUGHTS: Tarantino did present us with a portrait of this amazing place and time but not the reality,i think it came up short delivering a focused message or idea, my thinking is that Tarantino may have indulged too much in his own dream and view without translating his whole ideas to the rest of us .

BUT, i really enjoyed the movie as the ending was very satisfying,in my opinion, justice was served as it should've been back in the time.",4771

Now I don’t remember them showing any wings being actually sawn off, however, the villain had a wall of wings that she had stolen. The protagonists were two lovers, a male and female.  I barely remember the male, but he gives off green vibes if that makes any sense at all.  The girl/princess? was a fairy with like butterfly esque wings that were really pretty and the villain wanted to saw them off and almost does at the end.

380,1,"Help am I crazyOk, hive mind, help us settle a long running family conundrum. Can anyone definitely tell me what wizard of oz movie this is

Wizard of Oz 
(animated film that I remember picking out at Blockbuster as a small child)

Dorothy gets a new dollhouse, and when she opens it, she, Toto, and the doll she was playing with were transported to Oz. The doll comes alive (maybe replaces Scarecrow?), and the three characters set off to find their way home, carrying the dollhouse just in case it comes in handy. At some point they meet Lion, Tin Man, and Scarecrow(?). They are trying to find the Good Witch so that Dorothy can return home.

On the way, they come across a house made of quilt, from which they can smell freshly baked cookies. Hungry and tired, they see if anyone is home. They meet the owner and she invites them inside. It turns out that she has been turning visitors into quilt patches to expand her home. She does this to Scarecrow or Tin Man? And then turns on Dorothy. Dorothy manages to trap the Quilt Lady, pinned to the wall at the sleeve with her own needles, and speaks to her so calmly and sweetly that, almost as if put under a spell, the Quilt Lady loses all her maliciousness and lets everyone she has turned into quilts free.

Towards the end of the story when the group arrives at the Good Witch’s throne, they see that it is empty for many years. The Wicked Witch had searched for this throne for a long time in order to take it for herself and gain more power, but could only find it by following Dorothy. Lion realizes that the reason Dorothy found the throne, and what gave her the seemingly magical ability to turn evil people good, was because she was meant to become the next Good Witch. In a scuffle with the flying monkeys, the Wicked Witch tired using her magic to stop Dorothy before she reached the throne, but Lion jumped in the way, taking the blow. Dorothy almost stops then, but Lion urged her to keep going. When she reaches the throne she undergoes a bippity-boppity-boo type  transformation and becomes the Good Witch that she had been searching for the whole time.

That’s everything I can remember. It could be real and super obscure so that I can’t find it no matter what I Google, or something my childhood brain put together (but I didn’t know that there was a quilt character named Scraps in the book series or any movie or tv show until years after this memory).",2425

When it comes to the scenes I recall three.

1.
The two warriors are in front of their lord, or employer. They are testing their skills. The first one is a Asian man with long black hair and long robes, against two solider he uses very fine thread that really can’t be seen to defeat them, he was going to kill them but the other warrior objects. Now the other warrior( the one who objected eariler) fights some soldiers use hand to hand, as well as knife skill. When it comes to his appearance He could be Asian, but maybe he was white? I cannot recall.

Second scene I Recall. 
This is at the end of the movie. The two warriors are fighting to get to a woman that is riding away with another woman I think, they are left behind to fight, whoever wins goes after her. They fight, but the fine thread guy is pulled to a tree by what I believe was a rope dart, similar to the AT-AT in empire strikes back, but to a tree. As the rope dart comes to the end, the blade strikes him in the chest. The other goes off to the girl/woman.

Third scene ( which will probably help the most )!
As the knife wielded catches up to the two woman on horseback, the main girl looks at him, and maybe because of her powers, it starts to rip his insides up to pieces, or explodes his heart. Most likely the formal, as he falls off his house they come up to him, say some things then let him die.

That’s all I have, it was when I was young, so if you have anything please let me know. The period could be similar to flying daggers or “hero” style of filming. I can not recall the language but it was Asian.",1821

All I remember is that: 

• The “nutcracker” was a weird dude in the woods

  • He had “goons” of some sort which were figures all in black. 

• Clara’s father was a soldier in a war (probably WW1/2) 

  • The “Nutcracker” took her to see him

  • I vaguely remember her mom being mean or something?

This shouldn’t be super important, but I think the “Nutcracker” looked like an owl-y (old, wise, a little crazy) type person and I think Clara was a young teenager.

I watched a ghost movie a long time about (2009-20013 i think) and I haven't been able to find it anywhere online with my description of certain plot points.

&amp;#x200B;

In short:

* Family (husband, wife, daughter, son) moves into home (if i remember it was a suburban home) 
* The son starts seeing ghost kids who eventually tell him the house is bad
* Weird shit happens and the dad gets one his of old buddies to set up surveillance
* After the friend sets up the cameras he gets electrocuted by telephone wires above the house
* The daughter meets a boy from across the street who (iirc) comes over and when he leaves gets killed by the ghosts
* The dad (iirc) eventually sees the son playing with a ghost in the living room through one of the cameras
* Things happen
* The movie ends with all the family dying on the same night
   * The Son dies in the kitchen 
      * He goes down to get a late night whatever and then a burned ghost crawls towards him (iirc he was told by the ghost kid that he died from catching on fire)
   * The daughter dies in her room
      * She wakes up and holds her torso and is convulsing until her torso either explodes or gets ripped in half
   * The mother and father die as well but i don't remember how

I watched a movie online years ago and I can't remember the name of it and its really bugging me! I only have faint memories of the plot so it might be a bit iffy.

It is about this woman who had a young daughter and we find out near the start of the movie that the daughter gets killed at the end but we dont know who did it. So anyway, the daughter always goes and plays with the neighbour next door, who is an adult who is on the spectrum (I am not sure whether or not he had autism), and throughout the movie we kind of suspect that he killed her, because it points towards him. But then one day, I think the mother is angry because her boyfriend is mad that she has a daughter and she takes her anger out on her. So she runs her a bath, lays out a pretty dress for some party she is going to and then puts her in the bath. She then holds her head under water and drowns her. Then the neighbour walks in and finds what she did. (This is where it gets real blurry for me!) She either frames him for the murder or something idk. 

Any help whatsoever is appreciated.

Again my recolletion of the speech this old man was making is very flou but the old man was sipping his drink while talking about drunkness and how wine and liquor are a social lubricant.

I'm looking for a specific Asian movie for ages now, saw it somewhat years ago and forgot about the name. But the story never completely let me go.

The movie played around a private investigator/policeman who went to the entrance of hell to find a specific girl, he found this girl/demon and brought her back to the real world and tried to nurse her back to health.  
The plot twist was either the girl was abducted by him or not real (can't remember) and he was just seeing things.

Hello guys
I will cut short to the movie: IT HAS HAUNTED ME EVER SINCE. 
So, I watched it around 6 yrs ago, it was on a CD. It wasn’t an old movie, I remwmber laughing the hardest I have ever laughed. 
So, what I remember: there were 2 couples(I think) and one person had a house on the lake. A girl forgot a dress(or a phone, idk) at a friend s house and the friend went to the lake house to bring it. It was an expensive house. 
At some point, JK Rowling( i think) arrived at the house and they were pretending that they are someone else, but still from the group. 
For example, I am Gina, but I said I was my firend, Amy. Then, Amy showed up and she had to pretend she was me. 
I remember there was a gay house designer and a girl had to pretend he was her bf. 
PLEASE! Help me! I spent more than 72 hours looking for this movie. I am truly desperate!
Many details may be blurred, but I surely remember that the plot was the fact that they had to pretend they were smone else from the group because someone lied at first. 
Help me!!! Thank you❤️",1082

The movie started in a snow filled graveyard and the protagonist was telling his son about the best summer he'd ever lived as a kid. He was talking about how he left his home for a few days and went on a trip through the forest to try and find a treasure with his friends. There was another group of kids following them because they also wanted the treasure. At some point, the main character had to help a girl after she stepped on a landmine. Near the end of the movie, they got into a cave and jumped into a river. The movie ends with the kid getting out of that town with a necklace given to him by that same girl. That necklace was left on a grave by the now adult protagonist and his kid, where the movie had previously started.

I want to find it, because I never finished it and only saw the beginning, I think. I may have just come across a random scene when skipping channels. Anyways, it was set in a town that reminds me of the town in Babes in Toyland and the villian seems similar: over the top and in love with the pretty girl who's in love with someone else. 
In the scene I saw, the village had gathered in a crowd to watch the villian announce his engagement. The girl was sad or crying. Then her boyfriend shouts from the crowd or tries to rescue her, but the villian uses some thick green gassy smoke on the guy. The smoke does something... I can't remember what. Makes you evil, turns you into a monster, knocks you out?... I think the smoke was a big part of the movie - like why the villian had control (for fear) over the villagers.
I think it's an older movie like Wizard of Oz or Babes in Toyland. Maybe from the 50s or 60s, but I saw it in the early 2000s on TV. I can't recall faces and I didn't know any of the actors at the time.

Okay so I remember watching this movie as a kid probably around 2006-2008, it was a very artistic gore movie and i can remember 2 specific things about this film. 

1. a scene where some dark skinned girl (possibly Latina? I'm not sure) literally rips out her eye/s and sticks it to a wall covered in graffiti and other blood/body parts
2. a scene where these 2 men (might have been hired???) receive a phone call off someone (IDK who) just after they murdered some lady,,, while one of them is on the phone they are both eating this dead womans guts (cut off chunks of skin, used the skin like how you would use Doritos) and have also attached a vacuum to her mouth and turned it on to suck out her insides? Also the lady's dog was eating her stomach scraps..

uhh so its kinda messed up and i also may think it has gang themes in it I'm not too sure.

594,1,"Weird film I saw in IFC years and years agoSo this is a really, really weird movie I saw years ago. One that just brought up repressed memories as I tried to remember it. 

I only caught this movie half way through when I was younger, and changed the channel when I got freaked out, but it's been stuck in my head for years. But it has to be from the 2000s and follows high school students. It's been awhile, and though I remember the scenes, I dont remember the order of them. The part of the movie I watched starts at a party where a guy walks up to a girl and asks if she wants to ""rip a fat fart on his face"" he is rejected and comments there's no sluts at the party. Then an alien walks by with a beer, and the guy is then murdered by another dude with a can of tomato soup. The next scene has a guy dropped off by aliens after being abducted and knocks on a dude's window while he's nude. He asks if he can crash at his place and they sleep naked together. The last scene I remember is the one that always haunts me, but it's a guy and a girl in their respective rooms crying and watching gospel tv, where the preacher tells them they'll go to heaven after they die, so they kill themselves. The guy does so by laying on the countertop and sticking his head in the oven, and the girl slits her wrists and covers the walls of her room in more blood than a Tarantino film. 

This all just popped back into my head again, and I've finally decided to put this question to bed and find this film.",1497

603,1,"I'm looking for a movie, where in the ending a guy tries to high jack a plane, fails and shoots himself. 

I saw this movie when I was younger so it probably came out around 2010. The ending was really emotional, I'm not sure if it was an action, seemed more like a drama about a guy who was troubled.

It's literally killing me because I saw this movie on channel that I dont even remember, and I only saw the ending.

There is a guy in a brown suit i believe, the only thing I remember about him is that he had nerdy glasses and a bushy mustache. anyways he leans back in his chair waiting for his flight. I guess the scene focuses on him with the impressing that he's thinking about what he's about to do. When he gets on the flight I remember him pulling out a gun and holding everyone hostage. He goes to cockpit and the pilot tries to comply with him.

But I guess he has a bit of psychosis or something. The man's voice starts to contort, from the perspective of the main character and he shoots the assistant in the head. As a reaction the guy leaves and grabs a woman hostage from the deck and tells her to help the pilot. the pilot tells him that he can fly the plane just fine by himself but he goes into the psychosis state again and shots him in the arm.

Soon the SWAT team come in and shoot him in the gut. He sits on the floor paralyzed, while trying to laugh off the shitting situation. There is some dialogue in his mind of someone who I guess is important to him. I dont remember what he said, something along the lines of show them what you got, or you're better then this or something. He smiles at the memory and shoots himself in the head.

The camera pans out, not even showing the event, zooming out to the city where a TV is playing. News broadcasting the incident. A remember a woman saying. ""We are not sure if the perpetrator was trying to hurt anyone or simply hurt himself.""

the Tv is in an apartment which I assumed to be the main characters. And I guess it ends with a memory of him running around the house holding a toy plane. Pretending to fly it like a child. and then the movie ends I guess.

Like is this a TV show, or a Movie? Cause like this memory is killing me and it wont go away.",2225

I'm pretty sure it was made before the turn of the century, like 80s or 90s.

I watched around 2016 \~ 2018, but I am pretty sure it was a rerun so it might go down to 2012 or so.

I think this is an independence film.

The movie takes a place in some kind of fancy nice resort (or elder care center/hotel) where everyone enjoys their elderly life. It has pools, stretching class (like yoga?), sauna, and fancy dining restaurant. The place is nothing like some everyday normal elder care place.

Still, the place is a bit old, so the rooms that people are staying are bit rusty and has one of those old bathroom pedestal sinks (you can tell that by the shape of the faucet).

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so there are two main characters. I literally cannot remember any of the characteristics of these two men. Anyway, they are both very old (fully grown in white hair) and are both staying in this resort.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the men's daughter pays a visit because she broke up with her fiance (soon to be husband). I am a bit blur in this that I do not really know if she found out this before she made a visit or she made a visit because she found out about this. Anyway, the reason why she broke up with fiance was that he was having an affair with some random lady.

Ok so this is a super weird part, but stay with me please.

So daughter (I will refer her as A from here) stays in her dad's room (sharing the bed -&gt; nothing sexy though). And one night she has a dream. In her dream, her fiance's affair lady comes up and dances on the bus. Not sure if her fiance was in that dream, but the affair lady was in for sure. As the affair lady dances, her face gets bigger and more scary and at some point, she screams and the A wakes up from the dream.

She makes noises so A's dad also wakes up.

There, she says to her dad saying ""He did not break up with me because of the sex""

Her dad says ""what?"" (or something similar)

She says ""Because I am great in bed""

Her dad says ""I know""

She says ""What? how do you know that?""

Her dad says ""Because I am great too"" 

Then the scene ends, (to make sure, this was nothing sexy-scene. It was more of a quite and laughing scene)

&amp;#x200B;

And things happen that I absolutely cannot remember.

At the end, one of the two old men commits suicide by jumping off from the hotel room.

And the left man has a little chat with his young crews (I guess he was some kind of movie producer or some media producer with his own crews).

Next, he decideds to find his wife (or he knew about the whereabout of his wife but he lied to his colleagues about his wife's whereabout. I am not sure)

Then he visits his wife in the hospital (I think it is New York), and talks to his wife.

There in the hospital cell/room, his wife is like a dead person. She is alive, but her eyes are souless and her mouth is half open and body is lifeless. 

Last starring his wife, the movie ends.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought one of the man (the one who commited suicide in the movie) was Michael Caine, but I was wrong :(

Earlier this evening, I was trying to tell my husband about this movie, but I can't recall what the name of it was. It was one my mom found when I was a kid (she loves really obscure, messed up movies), so I didn't really commit the title to memory.
When I Google searched about it, no matter which way I try and type it in, I get a bunch of definitely not it, plus this lovely article about Shazaam and the Mandela Effect so... Here goes:

From what I can remember it was about this artist, like it all centers on him. He takes home this girl, and draws her because he's inspired by her beauty or whatever. Something happens and suddenly she's not around anymore and he starts obsessing over it all? The people around him are like ""yeah, don't know what you're talking about"" and by the end of it, they end up convincing him that she was all in his head. 
He feels better about it, and is like ""hey yeah, obviously she wasn't real."" But then the Shamallamadingdong twist is: he actually killed her, she was real, he's insane, and everyone else was wrong, but he gets away with it (I think?), because everyone around him doesn't believe she existed in the first place?

If any of that sounds at all familiar, I'd love to hear what you've got. I obviously can't remember the entirety of the plot (bad memory + seeing it once a decade or more ago), but if you've got questions to help narrow it down, or ideas based on parts - but not all - of what I've said, feel free to throw titles my way.

I literally can't sleep because of this dang movie rotting through my brain, so anything is appreciated. I'd love to hear I'm not just remembering some fever dream or something.",1708

705,1,"Thanks in advance for your time and help !!Hello Reddit!  
When I was young, and my dad still had time to hang out with me, he'd sometimes let me watch movies with him.

I'm trying to find the only movie I remember watching with him-- for the sake of nostalgia and being able to find another copy of it to watch again.

I remember it being an animated movie, dealing with huge robots. The pilots would control the robots via sync'ed movement (like [Pacific Rim,  2013](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663662/)), not a pilot seat (most mecha anime, such as [Mazinger Z](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1411817/?ref_=nv_sr_3?ref_=nv_sr_3)).

But it was one pilot per robot, not two pilots per robot.

I don't know if my memory is still accurate, but I'm gonna write it here in case it helps: I remember the animation style being more like [Appleseed (2004)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401233/?ref_=tt_sims_tt) or [FF Advent Children (2005)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385700/?ref_=nv_sr_3?ref_=nv_sr_3) versus other predominant animation style such as Neon Genesis Evangelion.

The one scene I remember is (I think) a fight or pursuit happening between mecha robots in a desert setting. The background of this scene was sand-color, and I remember a very ""cool"" looking mecha swinging his sword(?) backwards in order to stab the pursuer who was right behind him/her.

I think it has been like 15 years since I watched this one movie with my dad, and I've been wanting to find it for a long time now-- I didn't know this subreddit existed. I don't even know whether I'll ever be able to find it, but if I do, I will be very very happy.

He was supposedly straight but then it cut to them having sex with him. It was real, unsimulated sex and I want to say it was more of a documentary than a movie. It was NOT porn.

So, I remember seeing a trailer a long time ago, and would like to know what it is. I didn't even watch it but I would like to do so.  
First, the date: I only know it was released after *The Lake House*, the 2006 film with Keanu Reeves, and before 2010.  


The plot (from the trailer):  
So there is like a small projection room with black seats, the outside is white like an office.  
Scientists or whatever are watching a film. Actually, this film is the full life of a girl through her eye, a camera had been put in it since her birth, and she just died. We can see slices of her life projected in the room during the trailer, such as a moment when the girl played outside with her dog.  
The plot revolves around this.  


Unfortunately, I have no other memory of that, I only remember it was not a funny film but a serious one. I don't know anything else about the girl or the scientists.

868,1,"Trying to find a horror movie I watched long agoSo I would like to start off by saying, I viewed this movie in a motel about thirteen years ago. Which leads to me not knowing the title of the movie, I would also like to add I was about 10/11 so I could have majorly exaggerated.

To begin, we did not start the movie from the beginning, in clicking through channels we found it. It started by several people in a house for a reunion or holiday, I am not sure. They seemed like they regretted all meeting up and they began to get mad at a woman because she dug up a box with demons or heads in it. Like I said, I do not completely remember. After they argued a bit over the dug up box, the house began to completely shut down. There was no way out.

Skip forward and one of the women in the group was playing the piano in a white old time dress. Her friends gathered around her to see what she was doing and blood was dripping onto the keys. They tried to look at her face and it looked like she was possessed or it was altogether another entity. It got up from the piano and followed/chased them out of the room. (This part is important, I remember it perfectly) As she made it across the room, she was levitating or floating and her black pointed toe boots slowly drug across the floor.

Now to another part I remember, there was another group of people, or even just a couple. They were fighting or making up, not sure. They were frightened and scared of how they were going to get out. Then, a scary figure, that cannot be seen by the human eye broke glass and picked it up and began to slash a woman throat. The man with her could not see the being doing it to her, all he could see was floating glass cutting her throat.

The last fragment of the movie I remember is a couple trying to figure out how to escape and they find a bathroom. They think they are safe and the man tried to be a hero and he tried to get the woman to go out a tiny window. Just as she is about to, she spots the woman in the old dress on the ceiling and she comes down on the two.

Sorry I do not know much more. This movie always stays in the back of my mind and I just know it is because I cannot figure out what the movie is. Any help would be great!",2233

She’s going for a long drive to another town, at the border there is a guard, he’s enforcing an “animation only” law. He gives her a pill, after she takes it she’s animated and so is the rest of the movie. Any ideas what it’s called?",598
872,1,"Please help me try and find an obscure Italian move I saw around 10 years ago.I'm pretty sure it was an Italian (but might be another European) movie that is 5-15 years old. 

It was a pretty gut wrenching movie about an Italian executive (who is around 50 years old) who loses his job and slowly his life descends into turmoil where he can't afford their apartment and needs to sell his boat.  His wife in the meantime take a job, has a short affair with her boss.  The wife is involved in restoring a mosaic if I recall correctly.  The guy ends up finding work as a bit of a repair man and also as a delivery driver on a moped where he bumps into his daughter who wasn't aware that her father/parents were having financial problems.  The movie ends with the husband and wife together wishing/hoping for the best.

Hello everyone,  
I watched a movie about five years ago and can't find the name.

The movie was about a teenager whose sister has been raped and murdered. Someone found the sister on a beach. The police have found a suspect and brought him to the court hearing, but they don't have 100% proof that he is guilty. The teenager meets a deaf kid and becomes his best friend. The court then has another hearing and it looks like the suspect is innocent. The brother tells that to the deaf kid. They planed to beat the suspect up with a brick. I can't remember everything but there was a scene where the deaf kid pulled a gun out and pointed it at the suspect, then the suspect's mother opened the door and saw the gun. At the end of the movie there is a plot twist and you find out (SPOILER ALERT) that the suspect didn't actually murder the sister, but a biker gang did.",931

The movie is kinda strange but I remember that its a military movie of some sort, Im just going to tell you some scenes here and there that might ring a bell. 

There are some scenes where it jump cuts from another scene to another:

Volleyball scene, Japanese girl (mute uses hand signs) and there is this english dude who was watching her they somehow have some kind of relationship to each other and then another jump cut they are now on a hotel or something then she strips but the english dude refused to do something to her and then another jump cut

It was now set on a middle eastern country, there is kid who was peeping on this girl, he almost got caught and then he ran and went under a rock and started jacking off, and then another jump cut a new scene still on the middle east a bus was passing through the mountains filled with tourist and then some dude shot the driver and the bus crashed and also there is this man who had a wife they started talking for awhile until the man shot the driver of the bus (the man had a sniper and shot the bus driver, wife dies, husband lives) 
The husband finds himself inside a home he wakes up and those middle eastern dudes cooked him food he said it was good so he asked what it was (they said it was dog meat) 

And now another jump cut
Now its a military scene three guys infiltrated a base on a desert kills all the guys then finds a gold bars inside a bunker and then the movie somehow ends. 

Kinda f*cked up but thats what I remember I need help finding this one.
Those are not the whole movie those are just some scenes that I remember.",1763

I can’t remember which movie this was from, but there is a scene that stands out in my memory from when I was a tween that I can’t remember which movie it’s from. (I am just over 30 now)

Basic plot is like in Sixteen Candles, but the Hollywood-homely “Betty” character is a redhead with frizzy hair, braces, and is kind of a tomboy. She gets mad at the male lead for not realizing he’s looking for love with his hottie crush when she is right there and has a crush on him. I think they have a male best friend who advises the main character to go after her, and he ends up with her in the end. I also seem to remember the confrontation between the two happening at a diner or some other place with booth seating.

912,1,"Weird American Thriller Movie from 2000s... HELP?I was watching really bad television with my sister and we saw maybe the worst movie ever. We saw it in Italy but its 100&amp;#37; an AMERICAN movie.

There was no title page, and the credits didn't say the name of the movie but would love to know the name - if anyone can help here's a description below.

The movie is set sometime early 2000s (really bad hair, blackberry, a BMW that didn't look like an old model).

The protagonist was a woman named Jennifer who was a marketing manager at a firm called H&amp;R marketing. She is married to a man named Patrick who is a photographer/artist who has an exhibit in the movie called ""ANTS"".

The movie opens up with a murder and Jennifer holding a gun to Stephanie (blonde woman 2nd main character), and a flash back to the night before and the movie then starts from that flash back working towards that initial gun scene.

The flash back/real start of the movie begins with Jennifer at some fancy party and then a second scene happening at the same time a blonde woman (Stephanie) is having sex with some dude who then dies in his hot tub after she leaves.

Next Scene: Jennifer is working on a huge perfume campaign because the perfume company has a new VP named Terrance who is going to leave H&amp;R marketing for a different ad team.So Jennifer hires this psycho blonde woman named Stephanie who kills literally everybody all single white female-ing Jennifer, and obsessed with her in a very spooky way (saying she does everything for Jennifer, stalking people, etc).

Stephanie's list of murders/crimes:

\-rumored to have burned down competition marketing firm- guy in hot tub who gets electrocuted

\-Kills some dude selling car parts illegally at a flea market

\- H&amp;R marketing exec who came from NYC, she pushes his car into a truck with her car

\- stabs Jennifer's husband (Patrick)

There is also a plot running along this Jennifer/Stephanie narrative that is two cops who have really bad banter and take a long time to solve crimes - they are like shooting darts and drinking beer and eventually figure it out.

I know this sounds weird and crazy and all over the place - but it was a really great bad movie. I would love to know the name so I could watch it again and laugh

Much appreciation",2311

Said aristocrat wants to free his friend slave. Somehow, both of them end up in the middle of a conspiracy to assassinate the emperor of Rome. Both of them try to foil the evil plan before it's too late.

Memory scene 1: in the roman arena, the strong slave ends up separated from the group, and is approached by three roman soldiers who demand to know ho he is and what is he doing there. the aristocrat and the female freed slave don't know how will they get their friend out of that situation without raising suspicion, when the aristocrat, seeing the freed slave's earrings, has an idea, an ask for only one of her earrings and starts to readjust his robes. When the soldiers are about to arrest the slave, the aristocrat, with a very gay accent, scolds his ""naughty boy"" for wandering off, then says to the guards to never buy a gladiator slave, and winks at them. The guards laugh and then they go away.

Memory scene 2: the big slave, somehow, will fight for the private entertainment of the emperor against, in the words of one of the conspirators sitting at his side, an exotic fighter: a female warrior, a wild fighter who has not seen defeat yet. The female fighter, a short, very angry-looking and bulky woman, says she’ll rip his balls off. The fight begins, with the big slave on the defensive, and the woman on the offensive.

Memory scene 3: at the throne room, the emperor thanks the aristocrat for saving his life, and says that he can ask for anything he wishes. The aristocrat says that only wants one thing: the freedom of his slave friend. The emperor agrees in freeing the slave, after the payment of the standard fee of 3000 sestertius and signing some papers. The aristocrats almost faint, saying to himself “3000 sestertius!”.

Those are the scenes I remember the most. The movie was in color, either made in America or Italy, anywhere between the 70’s or the 90’s by the camera style. Anyone knows or heard about such movie?",2772

942,1,"Looking for an animated children's anthology from the 80sI'm trying to find a collection of short fairy tales from when I was a kid.

One story was about a child who goes into the woods because s/he sees some red flowers, and collects them and puts them in a gunny sack, and then sees orange flowers deeper in the forest, and then white ones, and keeps going deeper in even though the parents warned about the wolf. This one was animated in a paper-cutout style that I've never seen anywhere else - as in, 2-d stop motion animation. I believe the narrator was actually a child.

There was another story in the collection about an island that needed to be moved or saved from bad weather or something, and the clever barber enlisted the help of three giants, each one progressively taller than the others - the first one up to his neck in the ocean, the second up to his waist, the third only up to his ankles. They pulled on the island with ropes, and blew at the clouds, and stuff.
